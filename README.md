# First-Pet-Project

Java Pet Project

The main purpose of this project was to help me learn the java language and showcase what I have learned and used so far. The main idea is to have an application with a GUI, a simple login system, a hub menu which allows the user to select several different functionalities.


Motivation

The main drive for the creation of this project was the desire to try a different style of learning. I decided that I would learn the java language as I went along, building my program at the same time. While it was a rocky start, I would say that progress has been made.


Features

The project is being written on Java SE 9.0 with the Eclipse IDE.
The main features of the program to this moment are the login system, the calculator and the News Program. 

- Login system - the login system was the first thing built and works with an onboard SQLite database. There is a login screen and a registration screen which make several validations for the user input. Up to this point the system has been made to output "Success" when the user logs in successfully.

- Calculator - a calculator with an interface that works on the same principle as the windows standart calculator. That is to say that the expression that is calculated does not take sign positions and order in account. It calculates the first two numbers and then uses the result of that calculation to continue on with the expression.

 - News program - a program which shows six current news headlines from the BBC - World website. When the user clicks on a headline it shows him the entire article. The article's photos are also showed along with their specific text,under each image. If the program does not find images to use then it uses a stock error image since certain articles do not use the same html image tags that the program searches for. The JSoup library is used for selecting the data from the html files of the website.
